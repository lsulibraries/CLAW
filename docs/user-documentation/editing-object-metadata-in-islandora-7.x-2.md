# Editing a Basic Image Node's Metadata in Islandora 7.x-2

## Edit
Editing Basic Image nodes in Islandora 7.x-2 is like editing any other Drupal node. First you need to have the permission to edit the node, if you don't have permission, then you will not be able to see the `Edit` option on the node.

Selecting `Edit` takes the user to the node's metadata form and any field the use has permissions to edit can be edited (eg. modify text in text fields or textareas, replace file fields like thumbnails or other images).
